## **UVaT**
This repository contains the UVaT demo code. Running this demo code can reproduce the test results of the UVaT model trained on a randomly divided dataset in four experimental settings on six datasets. Please refer to the comparison with the SOTA in the paper for the specific experimental settings and data sets.

### **Requirements**
The environment configuration scripts have been integrated into the demo code and can be run directly through colab.

### **Inference**
To run the UVaT demo, please **click the open in colab button** to run the code online in colab.

### **Training and Analysis**
The full code for training and analysis will be released after the UVaT paper is accepted.
